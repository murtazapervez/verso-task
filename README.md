# FizzBuzz Project

A PHP implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem, demonstrating object-oriented programming, autoloading with Composer, and unit testing with PHPUnit.

---

## Overview

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming exercise where:
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz".
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
- For all other numbers, print the number itself.

This project implements FizzBuzz in PHP using:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Composer for autoloading and dependency management.
- PHPUnit for unit testing.
